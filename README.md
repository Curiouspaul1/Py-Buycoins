# Buycoins-SDK
Python client for Buycoins Africa's API

## Getting started
Installation via Pip:

```bash
$ pip install py-buycoins
```

# Usage
py-buycoins provides a suite of utility classes with methods that automatically generate graphql queries on behalf of the user, with specifications based off input arguments. With these classes, the generated queries can be introspected before being sent. py-buycoins also features a client class which executes the queries to the Buycoins API, over HTTP.


## Authorization
In order to use execute queries you must instantiate the client class with our access keys from the buycoins account. You'll need to provision the class with the \[PUBLIC_KEY\] and \[SECRET_KEY\] as follows:

```python
from py_buycoins.APIClient import BuycoinsClient
import os

client = BuycoinsClient(
    public_key=os.getenv('PUB_KEY'),
    secret_key=os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
)

```

Usually these keys are stored as environment variables, with the aid of a `.env` file, it's probably in your best interest to do so.


## Basic Usage [Buying crypto]
According the official documentation on Buycoins [here](https://developers.buycoins.africa/), in order to buy crypto we must fetch an active price ID, first using the `getPrices`. The client class also features some generic helper methods such as `get_active_price_id`, which can be used to fetch price IDs for the sake of orders to the API, instead of having to call the query generator classes. The query generator remains however. Once we have that ID, we can then use that to send a query via the `buy` query. We can do this using the BuyCoins class (query generator) as follows:

```python
from orders import BuyCoins

# fetches active price id for bitcoin
price_id = client.get_active_price_id(cryptocurrency='bitcoin') 

# generate query
buy = BuyCoins(
    cryptocurrency='bitcoin',
    coin_amount=0.02,
    price = price_id
)
order = buy.from_buycoins(response_fields=['id', 'cryptocurrency', 'status']) # generates query string

# execute query
resp = client.execute(query=order)

# OR

resp = buy.execute(client=client) # returns all response_fields from API by default
```
If you need to know what kind of fields are returned by the BuyCoins API, check the official docs [here](https://developers.buycoins.africa/).


### More Examples
#### Sending Crypto
To send crypto to an on-chain address all we need to do is call the `send` method from the `Send` utility class. We can also call `get_network_fee` to see how much we might be charged for the transfer.

```python
from sending import Send

_send = Send(
    address="1MmyYvSEYLCPm45Ps6vQin1heGBv3UpNbf",
    cryptocurrecny="bitcoin",
    amount=0.03
)

# generates query string
order = _send.send(respone_fields=['id','fee', 'amount','status'])

# sends request via the client object
client.execute(order)

# OR

# returns all response_fields from API by default
_send.execute(client=client)

```

### Making Custom requests 
py-buycoins also features a generic mutation/query generator that allows you generate your own queries from scratch. In the event that the utility classes, we provide don't meet your requirements, or the BuyCoins API is updated and the current utility classes haven't been updated to reflect the change; the `Mutation` class allows you create custom mutations, as per your specification.

```python
from gcore.mutations import Mutation

custom_mutation = Mutation(name="myMutation") # instantiate class with proposed name of mutation

# generate query string
mutation_string = custom_mutation.Mutate(
    fields=[('cryptocurrency','bitcoin'),('status','complete')],
    response_fields=['id','cryptocurrency','status']
)

client.execute(query=mutation_string)
```

A similar thing can be done for queries as with mutations

```python
from gcore.queries import Query

custom_query = Query(name="myQuery") # instantiate class with proposed name of query
`
# generate query string
query_string = custom_query.queryObject(
    response_fields=['id','cryptocurrency','price'] # example response fields
)

# OR if the query has query parameters

query_string = custom.query.queryObject(
    fields=[('id',1]),
    response_fields=['id','cryptocurrency','price']
)
```

## Upcoming Updates in V0.2.0

- Optional response_fields in generating query strings: static response_fields returned if response_fields not specified by default

- Extension of test modules and error handling modules.

- Extra helper methods available in client class.
